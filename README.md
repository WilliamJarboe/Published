# Old published projects
A collection of projects that were so old, I didn't know I should be preserving their source code...
Most of these were middle school projects.

The .exe files are all written in Java, targeted at Java 1.6.0.
The .apk files are all targeted to Android, for a S6's screen resolution. The extra space on new screens can actually be used as a safe spot to hide in the bullet hell games...
